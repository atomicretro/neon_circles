# Neon Circles

## A game of shapes and shooting things
The world has ended in a pulse of neon. Terrible demons have risen from the void. Only you have what it takes to defeat the demons and save humanity. Can you fight your way out of the Neon Circle!!?


### Description
Neon Circles is a claustrophobic shoot-em-up in the likeness of Space Invaders and Asteroids. Made entirely in JavaScript and HTML Canvas, it was my capstone project at App Academy. In the game your character is stuck on the inside of a circle and can only point towards the center. To shoot the demons shooting you, you must aim through the circle and out the other side. But be careful! Space is cramped, and one wrong move could spell your doom.
